## 2026-05-12: maturin develop not overwriting .so file

**Problem**: After `cargo clean` + `maturin develop --release`, the installed `.so` in the venv was stale — only 4 of 8 MinerU functions were available in Python.

**Root cause**: `maturin develop` reported success ("Installed rust-io-0.1.0") but the wheel installation did not overwrite the existing `.so` file in `.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/rust_io/`. MD5 hash of the installed file differed from the newly built one. Additionally, `patchelf` was missing, causing rpath warnings.

**Fix**:
1. `uv pip install patchelf` to fix rpath handling
2. Manual copy: `cp libs/rust-io/target/release/librust_io.so .venv/.../rust_io.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`
3. After patchelf install, need to verify `maturin develop` actually replaces the .so

**Prevention**: After `maturin develop`, always verify with `python -c "import rust_io.net as net; print(dir(net))"` that all expected functions are present. If functions are missing, manually copy the .so from `target/release/`.

## 2026-05-12: Code review — duplicate helpers and empty structured data

**Problem**: Code review found 3 blocking issues: (1) TableStructure populated with empty headers/rows, (2) _html_table_to_markdown duplicated verbatim in test and production, (3) test helper _parse_content_list diverged from production _parse_content_list_json (no figures/tables on PageContent).

**Root cause**: Initial implementation created test-only helper functions instead of importing from production. The test helper skipped _build_result path, so figures/tables were never populated through pages_from_raw. Table structured data was hardcoded as empty dict.

**Fix**:
1. Extracted _html_table_to_markdown, _html_table_to_structured, _block_to_markdown as module-level functions in mineru_parser.py (single source of truth)
2. _parse_content_list_json now calls _html_table_to_structured to populate real headers/rows
3. Test's _parse_content_list now routes through MinerUParser._parse_content_list_json + _build_result, exercising full production pipeline
4. Moved HTMLParser import to module level

**Prevention**: When implementing parsing logic, always route test helpers through production code paths. Don't duplicate utility functions — import from the production module. When populating structured data models, verify the fields contain real data, not empty defaults.

## 2026-05-14: Disabled invalid Codex MCP server

**Problem**: Codex global MCP configuration included `time`, but the current session did not expose a corresponding usable MCP tool while `codex mcp list` still showed it enabled.

**Investigation**: Checked `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, VS Code MCP configuration, and `codex mcp list`. The active MCP entries were in Codex global config; `time` was the only configured MCP not available in this session.

**Root cause**: Stale/invalid global MCP server configuration for `time` remained in Codex config.

**Fix**: Removed the global MCP server with `codex mcp remove time` and verified the remaining MCP list.

**Prevention**: After adding or changing MCP servers, run `codex mcp list` and verify the tools exposed in the active session match configured entries.

## 2026-05-14: Skill files skipped due to missing YAML frontmatter

**Problem**: Codex skipped loading five skills because their `SKILL.md` files did not start with YAML frontmatter delimited by `---`.

**Investigation**: Checked known valid skill files and confirmed the expected format is a four-line header containing only `name` and `description`, followed by the Markdown body. Inspected the skipped files and found they started directly with `# ...` headings.

**Root cause**: The skill documents had valid body content but lacked the required metadata block, so the loader rejected them before reading the skill content.

**Fix**: Added `name` and `description` frontmatter to `ts-react`, `rust-dev`, `data-analysis`, `agent-dev`, and `bioinformatics` without changing their bodies.

**Prevention**: When adding or syncing skills, validate that every `SKILL.md` begins with `---`, has a valid hyphenated `name`, a trigger-focused `description`, and closes the frontmatter before the Markdown body.

## 2026-05-15: MinerU batch review exposed parser contract drift

**Problem**: Code review found a blocking type mismatch in `upload_local_files()` parameter annotations and inconsistent response validation between the new MinerU batch methods and the existing single-URL parser path.

**Investigation**: Re-ran the relevant parser tests, then added regression tests for non-zero `code` responses in `_create_task()` and `_poll_result()`. Confirmed the new `_require_success_response()` helper handled batch paths but not the legacy path.

**Root cause**: The batch feature was implemented incrementally and the legacy single-URL methods kept their older ad-hoc response handling. The shared response shape drifted across code paths.

**Solution**: Typed `model_version` and `extra_formats` with the MinerU Literals, refactored `_create_task()` and `_poll_result()` to reuse `_require_success_response()`, and added batch status property tests for `failed`, mixed, and empty states.

**Prevention**: When introducing shared protocol handling, refactor all callers onto the shared helper immediately. Add regression tests for both the new feature path and the legacy path before calling the change done.

## 2026-05-15: Final verification caught stale test import

**Problem**: Task 10 Ruff verification failed on `backend/tests/core/test_parse_document_config.py` with an unused `pytest` import.

**Investigation**: Re-read the Ruff output, inspected the test file, and checked the branch diff. The file did not use `pytest`, and the final verification command intentionally linted it.

**Root cause**: A stale import remained in a config test that was included in the plan's final lint scope.

**Solution**: Removed the unused import without changing test behavior.

**Prevention**: When a final lint command includes files outside the current feature diff, run the exact command early enough to catch pre-existing style drift before final checkpointing.

## 2026-05-18: Progress log overwrite during documentation work

**Problem**: While drafting the database design and implementation plan, `progress.txt` was briefly overwritten with a single new line instead of preserving the full project history.

**Investigation**: Compared the working tree against `git show HEAD:progress.txt` and confirmed the file in the tree had collapsed to one entry.

**Root cause**: The file was edited with an accidental whole-file replacement instead of an append-style update.

**Solution**: Restored the full historical log contents and appended the new database planning entries at the end.

**Prevention**: For append-only logs, always diff against `git show HEAD:<file>` before and after editing, and prefer targeted patch updates over whole-file replacement.

## 2026-05-18: Database MVP batch exposed worktree and tool-environment assumptions

**Problem**: Database implementation setup hit multiple execution issues before and during the first batch: a slash branch name conflicted with the repository's flat `feature` branch ref, an interrupted pytest run left the red-test state incomplete, and `uv run ruff` initially failed because Ruff was only available through the optional dev extra.

**Investigation**: Checked `git branch`, `.git/refs/heads`, `git worktree list`, running pytest processes, and `uv tree --depth 1`. Re-ran the targeted pytest commands from the isolated `database-mvp` worktree and confirmed the failures were setup/tooling issues rather than database code behavior.

**Root cause**: The implementation plan assumed a slash-style feature branch and default dev-tool availability, while this repo currently has a flat branch namespace conflict and installs Ruff under the `dev` extra.

**Solution**: Created the isolated worktree on the flat `database-mvp` branch, resumed from the exact red-test point after interruption, and used `uv run --extra dev ruff check ...` for lint verification.

**Prevention**: Before executing future written plans, verify branch namespace compatibility with `git branch --list`, confirm the worktree path is active before writing tests, and run dev tools through the same uv extras/groups declared in `pyproject.toml`.

## 2026-05-18: Database session helper default created unmanaged engine lifecycle

**Problem**: Code review found that `get_async_session()` created a new async engine when called without a session factory, then dropped the engine reference without disposing its connection pool.

**Investigation**: Re-read `backend/src/dao/connection.py` and confirmed the default path called `build_async_engine()` inside the context helper. The existing test only covered the custom factory path, so the unmanaged-engine path had no coverage.

**Root cause**: A convenience default hid resource ownership inside a dependency helper. Engine lifecycle belongs to application startup/shutdown or explicit test setup, not to a per-session context manager.

**Solution**: Removed the default path and made `get_async_session()` require an explicit session factory. Added a regression test that calling it without a factory raises `TypeError`.

**Prevention**: Avoid convenience constructors in lifecycle-sensitive DAO helpers. Tests should cover any fallback branch that allocates external resources, or that branch should not exist.

## 2026-05-18: Alembic script_location resolution is CWD-relative, not ini-relative

**Problem**: `script_location = migrations` in `database/alembic.ini` failed when running `uv run alembic` from `backend/` — Alembic resolved the path relative to CWD rather than the ini file directory.

**Investigation**: Tested with Python `Config.get_main_option('script_location')` and `ScriptDirectory.from_config()`. Confirmed that Alembic's `ScriptDirectory` resolves `script_location` from the current working directory, not from the ini file location, despite documentation suggesting otherwise.

**Root cause**: Alembic resolves relative `script_location` paths against the CWD where the Alembic command is invoked, not against the directory containing `alembic.ini`.

**Solution**: Used Alembic `%(here)s` interpolation which expands to the directory containing the ini file: `script_location = %(here)s/migrations`. This makes migration commands work regardless of CWD — both from repo root and from `backend/` directory.

**Prevention**: When setting up Alembic with a non-standard directory layout (ini file not at project root), always use `%(here)s` in `script_location` to avoid CWD-dependent resolution failures.

## 2026-05-18: Initial migration drifted from ORM metadata after review fixes

**Problem**: Code review found `canonical_evidence_items` in the initial Alembic migration was missing `current_best_status`, `conflict_flag`, and the `review_status` server default. The same review found `frontend_search_index` was attached to `Base.metadata`, which would make Alembic autogenerate treat the manual projection table as write-model drift.

**Investigation**: Compared `backend/src/dao/models.py`, `database/migrations/versions/*_init_mvp_schema.py`, and `backend/src/dao/search_index_repo.py`. Added migration capture tests that inspect `op.create_table("canonical_evidence_items", ...)` and a metadata isolation test for the search index table.

**Root cause**: The migration was manually written before the final ORM review fixes landed, and the read-model projection reused `Base.metadata` for convenience even though Alembic targets that metadata.

**Solution**: Added the missing canonical evidence columns/default to the initial migration, moved `frontend_search_index` to standalone `MetaData`, and added regression tests for both issues.

**Prevention**: When manually maintaining migrations, add tests that compare critical migration DDL against ORM metadata. Keep read-side/manual projection tables off Alembic target metadata unless they are intentionally migration-managed.

## 2026-05-18: Full backend pytest collection hit duplicate test module names

**Problem**: Running `uv run pytest` from `backend/` failed during collection with an import mismatch between `backend/services/model-server/tests/test_config.py` and `backend/tests/core/test_config.py`.

**Investigation**: The error happened before executing tests and reported that both files were imported as the same top-level module name `test_config`.

**Root cause**: Two test files in different directories share the same basename without package isolation, so pytest can import one as `test_config` and then reject the second file with the same module name.

**Solution**: Verified the database branch with the targeted suite `uv run pytest tests/core/test_database_config.py tests/dao -q`, which covers all changed backend database files. Ruff also passed for the changed backend database and migration files.

**Prevention**: Give duplicate test basenames package-qualified imports by adding `__init__.py` where appropriate, or rename one of the duplicate files before relying on repo-wide pytest collection.

## 2026-05-18: maturin develop picks wrong venv across worktrees

**Problem**: After merging feature branch to main worktree, `maturin develop --release` failed because it found Python 3.11 in `rust-io/.venv` (main worktree) while `uv.lock` requires Python>=3.12.

**Root cause**: Each worktree has its own `rust-io/.venv`. The main worktree's venv was created with Python 3.11; the feature worktree's venv had Python 3.12. After the merge updated `uv.lock` to require 3.12, the main worktree's local venv couldn't install.

**Fix**: Copy the `.so` from the feature worktree's build output to the main worktree's backend venv. Long-term: use `--manifest-path` with maturin to target the correct Python, or ensure all local venvs use the same Python version.

**Prevention**: After merging Rust changes across worktrees, rebuild in the target worktree with the correct Python version, or copy the `.so` explicitly.
